# Fertility Nutrition Guide: Foods to Boost Your Reproductive Health

What you eat can significantly impact your fertility and overall reproductive health. While nutrition alone may not solve fertility challenges, a well-balanced diet rich in specific nutrients can support your body's natural processes and complement medical treatments.

## Key Nutrients for Fertility

### Folate and Folic Acid
Essential for DNA synthesis and cell division, folate is crucial for both male and female fertility.

**Best Sources:**

- Legumes (lentils, chickpeas, black beans)
- Citrus fruits
- Fortified cereals and grains
- Asparagus and broccoli

**Recommended Intake:** 400-800 mcg daily

### Omega-3 Fatty Acids
Support hormone production and may improve egg quality and sperm health.

**Best Sources:**
- Fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel)
- Walnuts and flaxseeds
- Chia seeds
- Algae-based supplements (for vegetarians)

### Antioxidants
Protect eggs and sperm from oxidative stress and cellular damage.

**Key Antioxidants:**

## Lifestyle Tips

## Conclusion
