# Frequently Asked Questions

We understand that fertility treatment can raise many questions. Here are answers to the most common questions our patients ask. If you don't find what you're looking for, please [contact us](/contact/) for personalized guidance.

## General Fertility Questions

### When should I see a fertility specialist?

**For women under 35:** After trying to conceive for 12 months without success.

**For women 35 and older:** After trying for 6 months without success.

**Seek immediate consultation if you have:**
- Irregular or absent periods
- Known fertility issues (PCOS, endometriosis)
- History of pelvic inflammatory disease
- Previous cancer treatment
- Partner with known fertility issues
- Recurrent miscarriages (2 or more)

### What causes infertility?

Infertility affects about 1 in 8 couples and can be due to various factors:

**Female factors (40%):**
- Ovulation disorders
- Blocked fallopian tubes
- Endometriosis
- Age-related decline in egg quality
- Uterine or cervical issues

**Male factors (40%):**
- Low sperm count or poor sperm quality
- Hormonal imbalances
- Genetic conditions
- Varicocele
- Blockages in reproductive tract

**Unexplained (20%):**
- No identifiable cause despite thorough testing

### How long does fertility testing take?

Most initial fertility testing can be completed within 1-2 menstrual cycles (4-8 weeks). This includes:
- Blood work for both partners
- Semen analysis
- Ultrasound examinations
- Specialized tests like HSG or SIS

More advanced testing may take additional time depending on your specific situation.

## IVF Questions

### What is IVF success rate?

Success rates vary significantly based on age and individual factors:

**Live birth rates per IVF cycle:**
- Under 35: 60-65%
- 35-37: 50-55%
- 38-40: 35-42%
- 41-42: 20-28%
- Over 42: 10-15%

These are general statistics. Your doctor will provide personalized predictions based on your specific circumstances.

### How many IVF cycles will I need?

Most patients achieve pregnancy within 2-3 IVF cycles. However, this varies greatly:
- About 30% succeed on the first cycle
- 50% succeed within two cycles
- 70% succeed within three cycles

Factors affecting cycle number include age, diagnosis, response to medications, and embryo quality.

### What medications are used in IVF?

**Stimulation medications:**
- Gonadotropins (FSH/LH) to stimulate egg production
- GnRH antagonists to prevent premature ovulation
- Trigger shot (hCG) to mature eggs

**Support medications:**
- Progesterone for luteal phase support
- Antibiotics to prevent infection
- Pain medications as needed

Your protocol will be customized based on your individual response and needs.

### Is IVF painful?

Most patients report that IVF is less uncomfortable than expected:

**Injections:** Small needles and proper technique minimize discomfort. Our nurses provide thorough training.

**Monitoring:** Blood draws and ultrasounds are routine procedures with minimal discomfort.

**Egg retrieval:** Performed under conscious sedation, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Some cramping afterward is normal.

**Embryo transfer:** Similar to a pap smear, generally painless.

### Can I work during IVF?

Yes, most patients continue working throughout IVF treatment. You'll need time off for:
- Monitoring appointments (1-2 hours, usually morning)
- Egg retrieval day (half day)
- Embryo transfer day (2-3 hours)
- Recovery time varies but is typically minimal

Many patients find that staying busy with work helps manage anxiety during treatment.

## Cost and Insurance Questions

### How much does fertility treatment cost?

**Initial testing:** $1,500 - $3,000
**IUI cycle:** $800 - $1,200 (plus medications $200-$500)
**IVF cycle:** $12,000 - $17,000 (plus medications $3,000-$5,000)
**Frozen embryo transfer:** $3,500 - $4,500

Costs vary based on specific protocols and individual needs. We provide detailed cost estimates during your consultation.

### Does insurance cover fertility treatment?

Coverage varies significantly by insurance plan and state:

**Commonly covered:**
- Initial fertility testing
- Basic treatments like ovulation induction
- Some diagnostic procedures

**Varies by plan:**
- IUI treatment
- IVF coverage (some states mandate coverage)
- Fertility medications

**Rarely covered:**

Our financial counselor will help you explore all available options.

## Treatment-Specific Questions

### What is the difference between IUI and IVF?

**IUI (Intrauterine Insemination):**
- Sperm placed directly into uterus
- Fertilization occurs naturally in body
- Less invasive and less expensive
- Success rates: 10-20% per cycle
- Good for mild male factor or unexplained infertility

**IVF (In Vitro Fertilization):**
- Eggs retrieved and fertilized in laboratory
- Embryo(s) transferred to uterus
- More complex but higher success rates
- Success rates: 40-65% per cycle depending on age
- Recommended for blocked tubes, severe male factor, or failed IUI cycles

### What is ICSI and when is it needed?

ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) involves injecting a single sperm directly into each egg. It's recommended for:
- Severe male factor infertility
- Low fertilization rates in previous IVF
- Use of frozen or surgically retrieved sperm
- Unexplained fertilization failure

ICSI increases fertilization rates from 60-70% to 70-80% in appropriate cases. Additional cost: $1,500.

### What are the risks of fertility treatment?

**IUI risks:** Minimal - slight infection risk and small chance of multiple pregnancy

**IVF risks:**
- OHSS (Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome): 1-5%
- Multiple pregnancy: 15-20% with fresh transfers
- Infection or bleeding: <1%
- Anesthesia complications: Very rare

**Multiple pregnancy risks:**
- Higher chance of premature birth
- Pregnancy complications
- Single embryo transfer reduces this risk

## Lifestyle and Preparation Questions

### How should I prepare for fertility treatment?

**3 months before treatment:**
- Start prenatal vitamins with folic acid
- Maintain healthy weight
- Quit smoking and limit alcohol
- Manage stress levels
- Regular moderate exercise

**1 month before:**
- Complete all required testing
- Begin any prescribed medications
- Arrange work schedule flexibility
- Ensure adequate support system

**During treatment:**
- Attend all appointments
- Take medications as prescribed
- Maintain healthy lifestyle
- Stay hydrated and get adequate rest

### Can I exercise during fertility treatment?

**Pre-treatment:** Regular moderate exercise is beneficial and may improve fertility.

**During stimulation:** Light exercise only (walking, gentle yoga). Avoid:
- High-impact activities
- Heavy lifting
- Intense workouts
- Activities with fall risk

**After procedures:** Resume normal activities gradually as directed by your care team.

### What foods should I eat or avoid?

**Beneficial foods:**
- Folate-rich vegetables (spinach, broccoli)
- Lean proteins (fish, poultry, legumes)
- Whole grains
- Healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil)
- Antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables

**Limit or avoid:**
- High-mercury fish
- Excessive caffeine (limit to 1-2 cups coffee/day)
- Alcohol
- Processed foods
- Trans fats

Stay hydrated and maintain stable blood sugar levels with regular, balanced meals.

## Age and Timing Questions

### Is there an age limit for fertility treatment?

**General guidelines:**
- IVF with own eggs: Usually up to age 43-45
- IVF with donor eggs: Up to age 50-55 (varies by clinic)
- Male partners: No strict age limits, but sperm quality may decline with age

Age limits exist due to:
- Decreased success rates
- Increased pregnancy risks
- Medical complications

Individual health status is more important than chronological age in many cases.

### How does age affect fertility?

**Female fertility:**
- Peak fertility: Early 20s
- Noticeable decline: After age 32
- Significant decline: After age 37
- Marked decline: After age 40

**Male fertility:**
- Less dramatic decline than women
- Gradual decrease in sperm quality after age 40
- May affect pregnancy rates and miscarriage risk

The quality and quantity of eggs cannot be improved, making age the most important factor in female fertility.

## Emotional and Support Questions

### How do I cope with the emotional stress of fertility treatment?

**Normal to experience:**
- Anxiety and worry
- Sadness and disappointment
- Relationship strain
- Social isolation
- Loss of control feelings

### How do I tell family and friends about treatment?

This is a personal decision. Consider:

**Benefits of sharing:**

- Practical help with appointments
- Understanding if you need space

**Drawbacks of sharing:**
- Unwanted advice
- Pressure and constant questions
- Privacy concerns

**Middle ground options:**
- Share with select trusted individuals

### What if treatment doesn't work?

It's important to discuss backup plans from the beginning:

**Medical options:**
- Additional testing to identify issues
- Different treatment protocols
- Donor eggs or sperm
- Gestational carrier
- Adoption

**Emotional support:**
- Grief counseling
- Time to process and heal
