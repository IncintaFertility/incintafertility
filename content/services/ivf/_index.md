# In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)

IVF is one of the most effective fertility treatments available today. At Incinta Fertility Center, we offer state-of-the-art IVF services with personalized protocols designed to maximize your chances of success.

## What is IVF?

In vitro fertilization is a process where eggs are retrieved from your ovaries and fertilized with sperm in our advanced laboratory. The resulting embryos are then carefully cultured and the best quality embryo(s) are transferred to your uterus.

## Our IVF Success Rates

- **Under 35 years**: 65% live birth rate per cycle
- **35-37 years**: 55% live birth rate per cycle  
- **38-40 years**: 42% live birth rate per cycle
- **41-42 years**: 28% live birth rate per cycle

*Success rates based on our clinic data from the past 12 months*
