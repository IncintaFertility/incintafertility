### Warning Signs:
- Irregular or absent menstrual cycles
- Severe menstrual pain or heavy bleeding
- History of pelvic inflammatory disease
- Previous cancer treatment
- Known genetic conditions
- Multiple pregnancy losses

## Female Fertility Testing

- Physical examination
- Pelvic ultrasound
- Basic blood work
- Treatment recommendations

### Hormone Testing Panel - $450
**Day 3 Testing (Cycle Days 2-4):**
- **FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)**: Evaluates ovarian reserve
- **LH (Luteinizing Hormone)**: Assesses hormonal balance
- **Estradiol (E2)**: Measures estrogen levels
- **TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)**: Thyroid function
- **Prolactin**: Hormone that can affect ovulation

**Mid-Luteal Testing (7 days after ovulation):**
- **Progesterone**: Confirms ovulation occurred

### Advanced Ovarian Reserve Testing - $200
- **AMH (Anti-MÃ¼llerian Hormone)**: Best predictor of egg quantity
- **Antral Follicle Count**: Ultrasound measurement of developing follicles
- Results available within 24-48 hours

### Ovulation Assessment
**Ovulation Predictor Kits**: At-home monitoring
**Luteal Phase Defect Testing**: Progesterone levels
**Ovulation Tracking**: Ultrasound monitoring

### Fallopian Tube Evaluation

#### HSG (Hysterosalpingogram) - $650
- X-ray with contrast dye
- Evaluates tube patency and uterine shape
- Performed cycle days 5-10
- 15-minute outpatient procedure

#### SIS (Saline Infusion Sonogram) - $400
- Ultrasound with saline infusion
- Evaluates uterine cavity
- Less invasive than HSG
- No radiation exposure

### Genetic Testing - $300-$1,200
**Carrier Screening:**
- Cystic fibrosis
- Spinal muscular atrophy
- Fragile X syndrome
- Ethnic-specific panels (Jewish, Mediterranean, etc.)

**Karyotype Analysis:**
- Chromosomal abnormalities
- Recommended after recurrent pregnancy loss

### Specialized Testing

#### Endometrial Biopsy - $450
- Evaluates uterine lining
- Performed in late luteal phase
- Rules out endometritis or abnormal cells

#### Laparoscopy - $3,500-$5,000
- Minimally invasive surgery
- Diagnoses endometriosis, adhesions, fibroids

**Basic Parameters:**
- Sperm concentration (count)
- Motility (movement)
- Morphology (shape)
- Volume and pH
- White blood cell count

**Advanced Analysis:**
- Strict morphology assessment
- Computer-assisted analysis
- DNA fragmentation testing

#### Normal Values:
- **Volume**: 1.5-5.0 mL
- **Concentration**: >15 million/mL
- **Total count**: >39 million per ejaculate
- **Motility**: >40% moving
- **Morphology**: >4% normal forms

### Hormone Testing for Men - $300
- **Testosterone**: Male hormone levels
- **FSH**: Pituitary function
- **LH**: Stimulates testosterone production
- **Prolactin**: Can affect testosterone

### Advanced Male Testing

#### Sperm DNA Fragmentation - $350
- Measures genetic damage in sperm
- Important for IVF success
- Recommended if:
  - Unexplained infertility
  - Recurrent pregnancy loss
  - Failed IVF cycles
  - Advanced paternal age

#### Post-Ejaculatory Urinalysis - $100

- For men with no sperm in ejaculate
- Can be combined with IVF/ICSI

### Genetic Testing for Men - $400
- Y-chromosome microdeletions
- Cystic fibrosis carrier screening
- Karyotype analysis

## Unexplained Infertility Workup

When standard testing is normal but pregnancy hasn't occurred, additional evaluation may include:

### Advanced Testing - $800-$1,500
- **Immunological testing**: Antisperm antibodies
- **Endometrial receptivity testing**: ERA biopsy
- **Sperm penetration assay**: Functional testing
