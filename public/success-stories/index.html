She gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Lucas, in 2022.</p><p><strong>Jennifer&rsquo;s Words:</strong> <em>&ldquo;I thought PCOS meant I&rsquo;d never have children naturally.

They have frozen embryos for future siblings.</p><p><strong>Maria&rsquo;s Words:</strong> <em>&ldquo;Cancer took a lot from me, but it wasn&rsquo;t going to take away my chance to be a mother.

We&rsquo;re planning to give her a sibling next year using our frozen embryos.&rdquo;</em></p><p><strong>David&rsquo;s Words:</strong> <em>&ldquo;Watching Maria hold Sofia for the first time, I knew we&rsquo;d made the right choice.

The condition had caused severe scarring and blocked her fallopian tubes.</p><p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Lisa underwent laparoscopic surgery to remove endometriosis and repair her tubes, followed by IVF when natural conception didn&rsquo;t occur after 6 months.</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The second IVF cycle was successful, and Lisa gave birth to healthy baby boy, Alexander, in 2022. They&rsquo;re currently planning for a second child.</p><p><strong>Lisa&rsquo;s Words:</strong> <em>&ldquo;I lived with terrible pain for years before getting the right diagnosis.

During the IVF process, they discovered that Amanda&rsquo;s eggs had fertilization issues that weren&rsquo;t apparent in testing.</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> IVF with ICSI solved the fertilization problem, and Amanda is currently 12 weeks pregnant with their first child.</p><p><strong>Amanda&rsquo;s Words:</strong> <em>&ldquo;The &lsquo;unexplained&rsquo; diagnosis was so frustrating - how do you treat something when you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong? But the IVF process actually helped identify the problem. ICSI was the answer we&rsquo;d been looking for.

Initial testing suggested he might not be able to father biological children.</p><p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Robert underwent micro-TESE (microsurgical testicular sperm extraction) where sperm were found in small areas of his testicles. The sperm were used with Patricia&rsquo;s eggs through IVF and ICSI.</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Their first cycle was successful, and they welcomed their son Daniel in 2022. They have additional sperm frozen for future attempts.</p><p><strong>Robert&rsquo;s Words:</strong> <em>&ldquo;Being told I had no sperm was devastating.
